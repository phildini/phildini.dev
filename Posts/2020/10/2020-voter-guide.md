## The Weeds

**President: Biden/Harris**. Hopefully the Presidential choice is a no-brainer if you're reading this. If you're undecided, I'm confused. If you don't like this democratic duo, then I hope you'll join me in voting them in and committing to spending the next four years hell-raising so to keep them moving left.

**Congress: Barbara Lee speaks for me.** That's it that's the tweet.

**State Senate: Nancy Skinner** Skinner has pushed for youth programs, criminal justice reform, and climate action. She is a solid advocate for this region and the state.

**State Assembly: Rob Bonta** Bonta continually pushes for civil rights, equality under the law, and programs that lift up the least enfranchised. His record would be impressive anywhere, and is doubly so for coming up through Alameda politics.

**Judicial: Elena Condes** I want as a judge someone who has seen what happens to people in the system, and has had to fight prejudice and injustice and systemic bias their whole life. Her opponent, Fickes, also seems like a standup advocate, but Condes has just that little bit extra that gets my vote.

**Peralta Trustee** No endorsement here because every time I've heard Bill Withrow speak I've been convinced that his eye is on Peralta's bottom line, and not on students or faculty. I have trouble endorsing Heyman because there's nothing about him in the voter guide.

**AUSD School Board** I am the son and grandson and great-grandson of public educators. I will always side with teachers, and the teachers' picks. That means Heather Little, Jennifer Williams, and Megan Sweet

**Alameda City Council** Here's the hardest one on this list. Let's start with the easy part of it. Malia Vella is a shoe-in. She is possibly the most dedicated public servant I have met, and has received nothing but garbage from the worst parts of this city. After the kerfluffle with the fire chief, she was served suits multiple times in an attempt to recall her, suits she had to defend out of her own pocket while trying to have her first child. It says something rotten about Alameda that she has received so much abuse while others get wrist-slaps in the press. Beyond that, her voting record and activist work speaks for itself in her tireless defense of the most vulnerable.

Jim Oddie is harder, for me. I like Jim. I want to get beers with Jim. I went to school with Jim's daughter. But Oddie's record is... not spotty, but confusing. He has a tendency lean towards the center when pushed, especially in oral statements at council. I wish he would commit more, and his handling of certain gaffes, like the Fire Chief kerfluffle, leave a lot to be desired. 

But his opponents are awful, so he's a comparatively easy choice. Gig Codiga is a Republican who, based on his campaign website, might be keeping a red hat in his closet. Amos White is a nice guy, but I can't really tell what he stands for or what he plans to get done. Trish Spencer continues to fight tirelessly for the rights of the aggrieved money classes, the landlords and realtors of Alameda, and has a track record of making sure teachers in Alameda know their place at the bottom of the totem pole.

Vella, Oddie, in that order.

**Auditor/Treasurer** No endorsement. On the one hand its fun and small-town and cute and folksy that these two brothers have been doing this job for who knows how long. On the other hand, I like turnover in elected officials. Keeps everyone sharp.

**AC Transit Director At-Large: Victoria Fierce** Chris Peeples has been a thorough administrator and dedicated advocate for transit for decades, and there is a soft spot in my heart for him since we went to the same university and the same college in that university. 

I wish Chris a long and well-earned retirement when Victoria Fierce takes his seat. I'm proud to be a friend of Fierce, and think she will do incredible things as a herald for a new age of transit centricity and advocacy. Fierce brought her activism from Ohio to Oakland, and the landscape looks different as a result. As one of the founding members of East Bay For Everyone, Fierce has helped raise the level of discourse around housing in the East Bay, while always remembering that transit has to be part of housing justice. I'm excited to see what she'll do on the dais.

### State Measures

**Measure 14: Yes** My family has a history of Alzheimers, you bet I want more brain disease research.

**Measure 15: Yes** See the note above about educators, now read it louder.

**Measure 16: Yes** The current system isn't working, let's try another one.

**Measure 17: Yes** When people have served their time, we should hand them a job, an aparment, and a ballot. These people are citizens, it was criminal that we took the right to vote away from them in the first place.

**Measure 18: Yes** I'm in favor of lowering the voting age to 16, so 17-year-olds voting in primaries seems like a step in the right direction.

**Measure 19: Yes** Our property tax law is broken and makes everything else we do harder. I wish this went further, but it's a start.

**Measure 20: NO** I'm pretty sure we as a society want more restoartive justice, not more prisons.

**Measure 21: Yes** More rent control sounds great!

**Measure 22: NO** Hell no. Uber and Lyft treat their drivers like employees, and should have to actually provide them those protections.

**Measure 23: Yes** Yes? No? I'm on a knife-edge for this one, but the way it's worded it might be fine? Feel free to reject my endorsement here.

**Measure 24: Yes** This isn't a perfect privacy law. There is no perfect privacy law. This is at least getting people to think about it.

**Measure 25: Yes** Cash bail is awful. The suggested replacement is hopefully less awful, but at least doesn't fund the predatory bail bond industry.

### County Measures

**Measure V: Yes** Yes? I guess? The unincorporate areas need services, so... we should collect taxes to pay for those services?

**Measure W: Yes** Half a percent sales tax to provide services to the homeless seems good? I wish it were a parcel tax, but you get what you get.

### City Measures

**Measure Z: Yes** HELL YES. Alameda has to build housing. Stylish multi-family housing close to transit sounds way better than sprawling into the Navy Base forever.

**Measure AA: Yes** It's a bunch of kitchen-sink charter changes for Alameda. Sure.
